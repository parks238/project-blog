I am sketching my idea for my page. For index page, I will use fixed frame and images are moved to be changed in the frame by scrolling. I am also using fixed scroll whenever user can navigate in the page. Background colors are matching my animation pieces and categorized by different colors. Gif images are such as a preview from my original version and each gif link to my original pieces.
