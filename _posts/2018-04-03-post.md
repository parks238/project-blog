My product will be about animation pieces that I made. The page will be such as a portfolio page or gallery with my work. For main page, it will be built up like a gallery with gif pieces that is from original animations. This gif images are like preview and user can pick the preview by their interesting. If you click gif images in the gallery, description of original piece is coming and it describe my concept, theme, process, and inspiration. User can be everyone who are interesting in motion graphic and they can share their ideas through my Vimeo link. 

Project Plan

-I will approach the project in emotional ways. My project will be interacting with users by color that is one of the most powerful tools in a web design. It can be used to attract attention, express meaning, create desire.
For purpose, color can be used to convey meaning or information about the product, as well as create a sense of cohesion between different element on the website. Color contrast can be used to highlight specific products. This is important in website design that information needs to be communicated quickly and expressively.
